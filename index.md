The page is the demo of "**Quasi-periodic WaveNet vocoder: a pitch dependent dilated convolution model for parametric speech generation**" [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/) [code]
## Abstract
In this paper, we propose a quasi-periodic neural network (QPNet) vocoder with a novel network architecture named pitch-dependent dilated convolution to improve pitch controllability of WaveNet (WN) vocoder. The effectiveness of the WN vocoder to generate high-fidelity speech samples from given acoustic features has been proved recently. However, because of the fixed dilated convolution and generic network architecture, the WN vocoder hardly generates speech with given F0 values which are outside the range observed in training data. Consequently, the WN vocoder lacks the pitch controllability which is one of the essential capabilities of conventional vocoders. To address this limitation, we propose the pitch-dependent dilated convolution which has the time-variant adaptive dilation size according to the given F0 values and design a cascade network structure of the QPNet vocoder to generate quasi-periodic signals such as speech.
